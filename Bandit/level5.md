Use the `ls` command to list all the contents of `bandit5` and use the `cd` (change directory) command to access the directory named `inhere`. Then use `ls -la` or `ll` to see the contents of the `inhere` directory. As you can see there are 17 directories in here. We need to find the directory that contains a file that is both human-readable and 1033 bytes in size. So use the `find` command with the flag `-size` followed by the number of bytes. In this case the command will be `find -size 1033c`. That will print the file name that is that size. After that navigate to the `maybehere07` subdirectory using `cd` and read the file `.file2` with the `cat` command.
