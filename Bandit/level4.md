Use the `ls` command to list all the contents of `bandit4` and use the `cd` (change directory) command to access the directory named `inhere`. Then use `ls -la` or `ll` to see the contents of the `inhere` directory. As you can see there are 10 files in here. Since we need to find the one that is human-readable you have to use the `file` command followed by `./-file*` which will return the data type of each file. After that you can see that the file `-file07` has ASCII text. Finally use the `cat` command followed by `./-file07` and to read it.
